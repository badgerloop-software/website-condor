                        </div>
                        <div class="posted-date"><i>Posted on: May 15, 2019</i></div>
                        <p>When we decided to start posting monthly updates at the beginning of Competition IV, we thought it would be a great way
                        for us to keep our supporters in the loop (pun intended) on all of the progress we made. These past 9 months have seen
                        the team go from concept to completion, and we’re now gearing up to begin testing the full pod towards the beginning of
                        June! </p>
                        <p><b>Here are some highlights from the past couple months:</b></p>
                        <p>Leading up to our Pod IV Reveal last month, everyone on the
                        team put in extra hours to make sure the event went smoothly. With only a week to go before the big day, it seemed as
                        though we were quite a bit behind schedule; however, after a few really long nights, everything came together and Pod IV
                        was ready for the world to see. Everyone on the team had a blast at the event, and we’re extremely grateful to all of
                        our sponsors and supporters for joining us!</p>
                        <p>Shortly after reveal, our attentions shifted towards the end of the semester
                        and final exams. That being said, everyone on the team stillfound time in their busy schedules to continue working on
                        the pod. Now that classes are done, many Badgerloopers are out of town for the summer. The few that remain will continue
                        testing and finishing the pod so we can ship it to California at the beginning of July.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we would like to celebrate all of our teammates who graduated this past weekend! Each and every one of them has been an integral part of
                        the team, and we wouldn’t have been able to get to where we are now without their expertise and dedication to
                        Badgerloop.</p>
                        <p><b>Congratulations to:</b></p>

                        <p>With competition only two months away, there’s still plenty of work to be done. We’ll be back with at least one more update before we
                        head to California, but until then keep an eye on social media for more Badgerloop news. See you soon!</p>
