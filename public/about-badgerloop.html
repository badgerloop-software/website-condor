								<h4 style="font-weight: 200px;">Badgerloop was formed in 2015 with the goal of competing in SpaceX’s first-ever Hyperloop Pod Competition. Thecompetition was established based off of the hyperloop concept first detailed in the <a href="https://www.spacex.com/hyperloopalpha">Hyperloop Alpha white paper</a>. In this competition, teams from all around the world design and build fully function hyperloop pods and then travel to the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, CA to compete against one another. In previous competitions, our teamfound quite a bit of success. First of all, we are one of nine teams worldwide to be invited to all three competitions. Additionally, our pod designs won innovation awards at Competitions I and II.<br><br>As this spring semester kicks off, we are looking to put the finishing touches on our Pod 4 design and to start building. We hope the lessons we have learned from the previous competitions will give us a leg up on the other teams. At the time of writing this, the specific details of Competition 4are yet to be released, but we expect it to take place early in the summer of 2019. </h4><br>

											<h2>Hyperloop System Concept Created</h2>
											<p>The hyperloop system is a concept created by SpaceX founder, Elon Musk in 2013. It involves a pod traveling in a low-pressure tube at speeds faster than air travel</p>

											<h2>Badgerloop Formed</h2>
											<p>Badgerloop is a student organization found on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. We formed in 2015 and competed in all competitions so far. What makes us so unique compared to the other teams and organizations on our home cam-pus is our team makeup. Consisting of primarily undergraduate students, we stem from a variety of major disciplines, including but not limited to, the College of Engineering, College of Letters & Science, and the Wisconsin School of Business. Anyone can join our team and find a place to participate and gain leadership. Our mission statement allows for each member to foster innovation, growth, and leadership while having an un-paralleled educational opportunity. Whereas most teams incorporate their pod systems into their graduate curriculum, we are teaching ourselves this information on the side of our school responsibilities. Our team is young and scrappy, but we pursue an instrument far more powerful than any other form of transportation, and we hope you view this opportunity as an investment toward our education.</p>

											<h2>Competition I- Design Weekend</h2>
											<p>In the first ever hyperloop competition, a small group of engineers created a design and a few system prototypes to take to Design Weekend (held at Texas A&M in January of 2016). Not knowing what the other 127 teams selected were bringing we found out soon the judges liked us. Taking third place in the world next to MIT and Delft of the Netherlands, we came back to campus and started building our actual pod design./p>

											<h2>Competition I- Test Track Runs</h2>
											<p>One year later we drove across the country from Wiscon-sin to California to compete our finalized pod. After working around the clock for many months leading up to the competition we were honored to compete next to 25 other teams. Due to technical complications, our pod was not able to test down the track but we still impressed the judges and took home one of two Innovation Awards! Also, we were the only pod that Elon Musk sat in.</p>

											<h2>Competition II</h2>
											<p>Building on the knowledge of the first competition, we quickly got to work designing our new pod for the second competition. In half the time as comp I, we submitted a design, got it approved, and were selected to be one of 25 teams to compete at the California competition again. We fabricated a simpler pod with the goal in mind to be the fastest. With great effort we built a fast, sleek, and functional pod that won us our second Innovation Award!</p>

										<div class="cbp_tmlabel">
											<h2>Competition III</h2>
											<p>For Competition III, we set our sights on making it into the vacuum tube (only six teams have ever done this) therefore prioritizing a functional pod over a revolutionary design. Despite unexpected challenges during testingweek, we were one of only four teams selected to present our design to the other teams, media, and other attendeesand proved ourselves as one of the best hyperloop teams in the United States.</p>
