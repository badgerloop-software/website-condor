								<h5>Founded in the Summer of 2015, Badgerloopis a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison helping determine if hyperloop could become reality. We provide members with the unique opportunity to work on real world engineering and transportation infrastructure challenges. Our members come from a diverse variety of majors and range in age from freshman to graduate studentsAt the Design Weekend competition in early 206, our efforts earned us third place out of 120 international teams. A year later in January 2017, we competed at Hyperloop Pod Competition I and took home one of two Innovation Awards. We are currently creating a light, fast and safe pod to compete in Competition II with the goal of performing best overall and establishing Badgerloop as a contributor in the development of high-speed transportation related technology!</h5>
