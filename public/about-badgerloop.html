												<h2>Hyperloop System Concept Created</h2>
												<p>The hyperloop system is a concept created by SpaceX founder, Elon Musk in 2013. It involves a pod traveling in a low-pressure tube at speeds faster than air travel</p>

												<h2>Badgerloop Formed</h2>
												<p>Within days of the competition announcement, a group of UW-Madison students joined together to form what is now Badgerloop. These students were highly motivated by the innovative challenge of creating a new mode of transportation. Utilizing any resources they were able to gather, they began planning for the first Hyperloop competition, the Design Weekend at Texas A&M.</p>

											<div class="cbp_tmlabel">
												<h2>Competition I - Design Weekend</h2>
												<p>Badgerloop designed and created a few system prototypes to take to Design Weekend (held at Texas A&M). Not knowing what the other 127 teams would be bringing forced us to think creatively about prototypes we wanted to show off. Our hard work payed off as we took third place next to MIT and Delft of the Netherlands. As soon as the competition was over we came back to campus and started building our actual pod design.</p>

												<h2>Competition I - Test Track Runs</h2>
												<p>One year later we drove across the country from Wisconsin to California to compete with our finalized pod. After working around the clock for many months leading up to the competition we were honored to advance to compete next to 25 other teams. Due to technical complications, our pod was not able to test on the track, but we still impressed the judges and took home one of two Innovation Awards! Also, we were the only pod that Elon Musk sat in.</p>

											<div class="cbp_tmlabel">
												<h2>Competition II</h2>
												<p>Building on the knowledge of the first competition, we quickly got to work designing our new pod for the second competition. In half the time as Competition I, we submitted a design, got it approved, and got selected to be one of 25 teams to compete at the California competition. We fabricated a more simple pod with the goal of being the fastest. With great effort we built a fast, sleek, and functional pod that won us our second Innovation Award!</p>

											<div class="cbp_tmlabel">
												<h2>Competition III</h2>
												<p>For Competition III, we set our sights on making it into the vacuum tube (only six teams have ever done this) therefore prioritizing a functional pod over a revolutionary design. Despite  challenges during testing week, we were one of four teams selected to present our design to the other teams, media, and other attendees. </p>

								<h4 style="font-weight: 200px;">Badgerloop was formed in 2015 with the goal of competing in SpaceX’s first-ever Hyperloop Pod Competition. Thecompetition was established based off of the hyperloop concept first detailed in the <a href="https://www.spacex.com/hyperloopalpha">Hyperloop Alpha white paper</a>. In this competition, teams from all around the world design and build fully function hyperloop pods and then travel to the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, CA to compete against one another. In previous competitions, our teamfound quite a bit of success. First of all, we are one of nine teams worldwide to be invited to all three competitions. Additionally, our pod designs won innovation awards at Competitions I and II.<br><br>As this spring semester kicks off, we are looking to put the finishing touches on our Pod 4 design and to start building. We hope the lessons we have learned from the previous competitions will give us a leg up on the other teams. At the time of writing this, the specific details of Competition 4are yet to be released, but we expect it to take place early in the summer of 2019. </h4><br> -->
